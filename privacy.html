            <h1>Privacy Policy for Formmate</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 25, 2025</p>

            <p>At Formmate, accessible from [Your Website URL], one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that is collected and recorded by Formmate and how we use it.</p>

            <h2>Your Privacy is Our Priority</h2>
            <p>Our Image Resize Tool is designed with privacy at its core. We want to be completely transparent about our data practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Image Uploads to Our Servers:</strong> All image processing is done directly in your web browser on your own device (client-side). The images you select for resizing are never uploaded, stored, or transferred to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not require you to sign up, log in, or provide any personal information like your name or email address to use our tool.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Log Files and Analytics</h2>

The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, and referring/exit pages. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement on the website, and gather demographic information. This data is not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</p>
            
            <h2>Cookies</h2>

You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser options.</p>
